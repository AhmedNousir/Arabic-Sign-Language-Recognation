# Arabic-Sign-Language-Recognation

Sign language consists of hand expressions and sometimes facial expressions of a person, and most ordinary people may not understand sign language clearly so there is a huge communication gap between deaf communities and the general public. Therefore there is an inevitability of technological support for people with a speech impairment as it is impossible to have someone present to translate what a deaf person is saying at all times. Through advances in science and technology, we can consider designing an approach that can interpret gesture signals into human text or automated text that can be decoded. This facilitates conversations between the deaf person and the speaking person, and indeed there are works in sign language, but they are all signs in non-Arabic languages, and therefore this work has been done on Arabic Sign language.
